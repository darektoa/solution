        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">In 2017 I moved to Canada to participate in the Victorian Teachers Exchange Program. I had no desire to ever do an exchange, until one day I said to my Principal at the time in Australia, that maybe I could do this. The next minute I knew, I was
            on the plane after never having lived outside of my home, let alone on the other side of the world. I just knew I had to do it, professionally but also personally. That year was full of many amazing memories of travel, teaching experiences,
            personal growth, and friendships. In the last 6 months of the exchange I met the love of my life, well, I thought I did. We had all these future plans of him moving to Australia and then myself making the move to Canada eventually. It was
            great. What a life I believed we would have. So in 2018, we had a long distance relationship for the year. It was all going as great as it could have considered that we were living apart every day. He constantly told me how much he loved me
            and how he was going to make it work. I went on vacation for two weeks to see him and he traveled to Australia for 2 weeks to see me, and it was wonderful. Then at the end of 2018, my world came crashing down. He told me he was not moving
            to Australia and I had to move there if I wanted to be with him. After weeks of emotional days and nights, I decided that I was not going to give up my whole life for someone who was not even willing to give me a year of his life or for him
            not to even compromise and give up part of his life. As you can imagine, I was heartbroken with all the broken promises he had promised me over the last 15 months. I spent another week an emotional wreck. After so many broken relationships
            and the feelings of “No one will ever love me, I will be lovely forever. What’s wrong with me?” I discovered The Secret! I watched the movie plus I read The Magic book, and I followed the steps. I wrote my list of what I believed I deserved
            in a relationship and what I wanted in a partner. I read over this list every day, plus I implemented all the other ideas in the book and I set a date of when I would met this man. I can honestly say that just after 2 weeks of doing all this,
            I met the man of my dreams, my current partner, who I am madly in love with. It is like my list and my thoughts have transformed into my dream man. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am truly grateful for The Secret and how it has helped me
            to really see what I wanted and deserved in my life. So thank you, thank you, thank you so very much!.</p>
